### About Myself
#### Hey! I'm Zach, and I'm an FY23 Aspire and recent graduate of the University of Minnesota (Go Gophs) with a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems. Recently I relocated to beautiful Seattle, WA and began my journey specializing in security and analytics. 
#### Outside of work, I am a proud born-and-raised Minnesotan and passionate Minnesota sports fan (for better or worse).
